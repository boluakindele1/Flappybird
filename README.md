# Flappybird
This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic game Flappy Bird. Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a series of obstacles without hitting them.
The graphics are rendered using Java's built-in AWT library , creating a visually appealing and interactive game interface.
The game offers a simple and intuitive control scheme, allowing players to control the bird's flight by pressing a key or clicking the mouse.
